**Capital Expenditure:**
- CapEx refers to the money a company invests in assets like buildings, machinery, or equipment that will be used for a long time

**Operational Expenditure:**
- This refers to the day-to-day expenses that a company incurs in order to run its business.
- It includes costs like rent, utilities, wages, office supplies, and other expenses necessary for ongoing business operations.

#### On-Premises Infrastructure

**Location:**
- Hardware, servers, and equipment are within the company's premises or data center.

**Capital Expenditure:**
- Requires substantial initial investments for hardware, software, and setup.

**Facilities:**
- Server rooms
- Proper cooling mechanisms are required to maintain optimal operating temperatures.

**Maintenance:**
- The organization is responsible for ongoing maintenance, updates, security, and system upgrades.

**Scalability:**
- Scalability is limited by the available physical space and the capacity of the on-site hardware.

**Disaster Recovery:**
- The organization must have a disaster recovery plan in place, which can include backup systems and off-site storage solutions.


**Virtualization:**
- Dividing physical server into multiple logical machines using software called Hypervisor

**Hypervisor:**
- it manages multiple os on single host

1. type 1- **Bare Metal:** hypervisor directly installed on hardware
2. type 2- **Hosted** -> hypervisor installed on host os


**Cloud Computing:**

- Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computer resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet.

#### On-Premises vs. Cloud Infrastructure

Advantages of Cloud:

Scalability: Cloud computing resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. 

Cost-Efficiency: Cloud services typically follow a pay-as-you-go or subscription-based model, reducing the need for substantial capital expenditure on infrastructure. Users only pay for the resources they use.

Accessibility: Cloud services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, allowing for remote work, collaboration, and accessibility to resources across the globe.

Reliability and Redundancy: Leading cloud providers invest heavily in infrastructure and data centers to ensure high availability and reliability. They often have redundancy in place to prevent downtime due to hardware failures or other issues.

Security: Cloud providers usually have dedicated security teams and resources to protect their infrastructure and the data of their users. However, users are responsible for securing their own applications and data.

Automatic Updates and Maintenance: Cloud providers handle updates and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure, freeing users from these responsibilities and allowing them to focus on their applications.


Virtualization: Dividing physical server into multiple logical machines using software called Hypervisor
Hypervisor: it manages multiple os on single host
Types:


1. type 1- Bare Metal ->hypervisor directly installed on hardware
2.type 2- Hosted -> hypervisor installed on host os


Cloud Computing: Accessing computing services such as storage, networking, databases, software over the internet(remotely)
Benefits:
-accessibility
-scalability
-pay as you go model

Types:
1.Public ->cloud provider provides the infra ex. Aws, Azure, GCP
2.Private-> organization itself purchase the infra/hardware
3.Hybrid->combination of both

IAAS- Infrastructure as a service
PASS â€“ Platform as service
SAAS- Software as a service
